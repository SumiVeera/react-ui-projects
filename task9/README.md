- 🌈 Chakra UI
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS
- 💅 Utility-first styling with Tailwind + component styling from Chakra

## 💡 How It Works

- The navbar is structured using Chakra UI’s `Flex` component.
- Tailwind is used to style background (`bg-white`), shadow (`shadow-md`), and spacing (`px-6`, `space-x-4`).
- `Spacer` from Chakra pushes the avatar to the right.
- Avatar loads from a local `/images/profile.jpg` path.
